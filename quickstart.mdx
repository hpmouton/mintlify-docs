    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Database Connection Issues">
    Verify database credentials and connectivity:
    ```bash

    mysql -u username -p -h hostname
    
    # Test PostgreSQL connection
    psql -U username -h hostname -d database
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="file-lines" title="Log Files">
