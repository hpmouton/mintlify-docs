# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up your development environment for working with our Laravel-based e-recruitment platform and LMS with skill audit integration.

## System Requirements

Ensure your development environment meets these requirements:

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Composer 2.0+
- MySQL 8.0+ or PostgreSQL 12+
- Node.js 16+ and NPM
- Redis (for queue processing and caching)
- Git

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the main repository which contains both projects
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/laravel-enterprise-solutions.git
cd laravel-enterprise-solutions
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy the example environment files
cp .env.example .env
cp e-recruitment/.env.example e-recruitment/.env
cp lms-skill-audit/.env.example lms-skill-audit/.env

# Configure your database and other settings in each .env file
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install PHP dependencies for both projects
composer install
cd e-recruitment && composer install
cd ../lms-skill-audit && composer install
cd ..

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Database Setup

```bash
# Set up databases for both applications
php artisan migrate --path=e-recruitment/database/migrations
php artisan migrate --path=lms-skill-audit/database/migrations

# Seed with sample data (optional)
php artisan db:seed --class=ERecruitmentSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=LmsSkillAuditSeeder
```

### 5. Generate Application Keys

```bash
php artisan key:generate
cd e-recruitment && php artisan key:generate
cd ../lms-skill-audit && php artisan key:generate
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

## Running Individual Applications

Each application can also be run independently:

```bash
# For E-Recruitment Platform
cd e-recruitment
php artisan serve --port=8000

# For LMS with Skill Audit
cd lms-skill-audit
php artisan serve --port=8001
```

## Configuration Checklist

Before proceeding with development, ensure you've properly configured:

- [ ] Database connections
- [ ] Mail server settings
- [ ] Queue connections
- [ ] Storage settings
- [ ] Third-party API keys (if applicable)

## Next Steps

Now that you have the development environment set up, you can:

- Explore the [E-Recruitment Platform](/e-recruitment/overview) documentation
- Learn about the [LMS with Skill Audit](/lms-skill-audit/overview) features
- Review [Shared Components](/shared-components/authentication) that span both systems
- Check out the [API Reference](/api-reference/overview) for integration possibilities

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. Ensure all required PHP extensions are installed
2. Verify database credentials and connectivity
3. Check log files in `storage/logs` for detailed error messages
4. Confirm that your PHP version meets the requirements
5. Make sure all required ports are available for development servers
